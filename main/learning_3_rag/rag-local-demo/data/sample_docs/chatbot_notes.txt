The goal of the new customer service chatbot is to handle up to 60% of Tier-1 support requests. It should be integrated with the existing CRM system and capable of answering questions about product availability, pricing, and shipping policies.

In the future, the chatbot will also be trained to understand order history and provide personalized recommendations to users.
