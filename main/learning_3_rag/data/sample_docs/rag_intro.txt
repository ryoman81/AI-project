Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid architecture that combines information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying purely on a pretrained language modelâ€™s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant documents from an external corpus and then generates answers based on that retrieved context.

This approach is particularly useful when dealing with real-world knowledge that changes over time, such as company policies or product documentation.
