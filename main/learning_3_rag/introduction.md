# 📚 Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid system architecture that combines **retrieval-based information lookup** with **language model-based generation**. Instead of relying solely on the pretrained knowledge of a large language model (LLM), RAG allows the model to retrieve relevant external documents in real-time and use them to generate more accurate, up-to-date, and grounded answers.

## Why RAG?

Large language models have limitations:

- ❌ **Fixed knowledge** — cannot access new or private information after training
- ❌ **Limited context window** — cannot always process large background documents
- ❌ **Hallucination** — may generate fluent but incorrect answers

**RAG addresses these issues** by enabling the model to:
- 🔍 Retrieve relevant content from an external knowledge base
- 🧠 Ground its generation in retrieved facts
- 📅 Stay up-to-date without retraining

## How It Works

```text
User Query
   │
   ▼
[Retriever] ← Search relevant document chunks using vector similarity
   │
   ▼
[Generator] ← Use the retrieved chunks to construct the prompt
   │
   ▼
LLM generates an answer based on both the query and retrieved documents
```

### Components
- Retriever: Finds top-k relevant chunks via embedding similarity (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB)
- Generator: A language model (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-2, LLaMA) that generates the final answer
- Embedding model: Converts text into dense vectors (e.g., E5, text-embedding-ada-002)

## Typical Workflow
1. Prepare Knowledge Base: Collect and clean documents (PDFs, Markdown, webpages, etc.)
2. Chunking: Split documents into manageable pieces (e.g., 100–500 words)
3. Embedding: Use an embedding model to vectorize each chunk
4. Indexing: Store chunks and their embeddings in a vector database
5. Retrieval + Generation: On user query:
    1. Embed the query
    2. Retrieve top-k similar chunks
    3. Build a prompt with query + retrieved context
    4. Use an LLM to generate the answer

## Common Use Cases
- 📖 Enterprise knowledge base QA
- 🏥 Medical or legal assistants with grounded documents
- 🧠 Personal document search (e.g., notes, logs, research papers)
- 💬 Customer support chatbot with context-aware responses
- 👨‍🏫 Tutoring systems grounded in textbooks
